## Identifying Functional and Non-Functional Requirements

### Q.1. Identify Functrional Requirements and Non-Functional Requirements:

### Functional Requirements:

#### Abstract: searching books and various parameters; exclusivity of borrowing the books ; username and password of the user and strong password requirements; book's location; librarian's permission for borrowing the book; displaying information about a book; history of books borrowed by a user; notification of overdue books to both the users and the librarian; admin portal; Non-member browsing; Web application only usable inside the institute LAN (Local Area Network)

- The user should be able to search for books in the library using criteria such as the title, author, publication date, etc., depending on their needs.
- The system should not provide the user the option to borrow a book if it has already been taken out by another user and should instead inform the user that the book has already been checked out by others.
- When a user wants to issue the book, the system should prompt them for their username and password. The system determines whether the entered information is correct, such as whether the password is entered correctly or whether the entered username is valid.
- The system should display the book's location in the library after it had been borrowed.
- Only if the user is a member of the system should the LIS (Library Information System) allow the user to borrow a book or return it if it has already been borrowed. Once a librarian acknowledges a user's request to borrow a book, the user is then able to do so.
- A system need to display all the essential information about the book.
- If a user requests a list of the books they have presently borrowed, books they have previously borrowed, the date they were borrowed, and the books they have returned, the system should display this information for that user.
- System should notify the user and librarian of the overdue books and calculate the fine for the overdue books when they are returned.
- When a new book is purchased, a system should enable the librarian to add a new record, or remove a record if a book is taken off the shelf, as and when necessary. 
- Admin Portal: The librarian should have administrative privileges and complete control over the system, including the ability to enter new book records and remove existing records.
- Non-Member Browsing: Non-members should be able to use the system to browse and search books online, but only members should be able to borrow and return books.
- Web Application: The final deliverable should be a web application that is accessible only within the institute LAN. This reduces the security risk of the software and ensures that confidential information is protected.
